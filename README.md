# DDosSecurity
This is a simple DDoS Security Plugin for Exiled and NWAPI. [This is my last plugin for Exiled.]

This plugin provides measures to mitigate certain types of DDoS attacks, helping to protect your server from overloads and lag. However, it's important to understand that no solution can offer complete immunity from all types of DDoS attacks.

The plugin is primarily designed to handle smaller-scale scenarios and may not be effective against more sophisticated or persistent DDoS attacks. Specifically built for SCP: Secret Laboratory servers, this plugin helps defend against attacks involving large volumes of network traffic. It works by analyzing incoming data packets, identifying suspicious or potentially malicious requests, and actively blocking packets that may indicate DDoS or other network attacks.
